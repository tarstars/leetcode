Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

```text
Input:  strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["eat","tea","ate"]]
```

Example 2:

```text
Input:  strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

Example 3:

```text
Input:  strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
